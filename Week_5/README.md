# OpenFASOC flow for 4-Bit Asynchronous Up Counter
Refer this [repo](https://github.com/syedimaduddin/4-bit_Asynchronous_Up_Counter_using_Mixed-Signal) for pre-layout simulation. In this design, the analog block contains ring oscillator and 1-bit analog to digital converter and the digital block contains four T-flipflops.

The pre-layout and post-layout of analog block ([Ring Oscillator](https://github.com/Swagatika-Meher/msvsd2bitcomp/tree/main/Week_3) and [1-bit ADC](https://github.com/Swagatika-Meher/msvsd2bitcomp/tree/main/Week_4)) is already discussed in previous weeks. In this section, we are going to explain OpenFASOC flow for 4-Bit Asynchronous Up Counter.
