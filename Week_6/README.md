# Xschem: Pre-layout simulation for 3-bit CMOS based TIQ comparator Flash ADC
## TIQ Comparator
In TIQ technique, it uses two cascaded CMOS inverters as a comparator. While the second inverter serves as a gain booster, the first inverter internally creates reference voltage (Vref). As we adjust the size of CMOS, the cascading inverters produce various switching/reference voltages internally which serves as reference voltages. The purpose of TIQ comparator is to transform an input voltage (Vin) toward logic '1' or '0' by estimating a reference voltage (Vref) with the Vin. If Vin is greater than Vref, the comparator output is '1', otherwise '0'. This occurs when transistor width is altered while keeping the transistor length constant. The gain boosters create sharper thresholds for comparator outputs and offer a complete digital output voltage swing.

Two inverters are linked in series on the TIQ Comparator for comparing and balancing. The threshold voltage of the inverter circuits can be modified to provide different reference voltages by adjusting the width of PMOS and NMOS transistors. In analog section of 3-bit ADC, $\[{2^n} - 1\]$ comparators that is, 7 TIQ comparators are connected parallelly using CMOS inverters. Where, n is the number of output binary bits.
